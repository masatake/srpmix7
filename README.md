# srpmix7

srpmix7 is a tool for source code librarians (and ctags hackers)

With it source code gathering from many projects can be stored well
organized way. The importance of "well organized way" for source code
readears is explained in my essay: "Toward realizing "Source Code Paradise" 
(http://fose2011.uwanolab.jp/FOSE2011_SourceCodeParadise.pdf, in Japanese).

ctags developers need test input. This tool can be used for manageing
such input set.

Requirement: zsh rpm(src.rpm expansion), rpmbuild(src.rpm expansion)
