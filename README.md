# srpmix7

srpmix7 is a tool for source code librarians (and ctags hackers)

With it source code gathered from many projects can be stored to the local
file system well organized way. The importance of "well organized way" for source code
readears is explained in my essay: "Toward realizing "Source Code Paradise" 
(http://fose2011.uwanolab.jp/FOSE2011_SourceCodeParadise.pdf, in Japanese).

ctags developers need test input. This tool can be used for managing
such input set.

Requirement: zsh rpm(src.rpm expansion), rpmbuild(src.rpm expansion)
